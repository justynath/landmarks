## UX

### Strategy
The primary objective of the site is to engage users in an entertaining manner while providing them with the opportunity to test their knowledge of landmarks worldwide. Additionally, the platform encourages users to delve deeper into their understanding by offering opportunities for further exploration and elaboration on their existing knowledge.


### Scope
I want the user to have the opportunity to see the visual representation of the landmark as well as be able to choose and answer from four given options. I want the user to get instant feedback on their answer and access additional information related to the question. I want the user to feel like they are learning by completing the quiz. I want the user to see their final score and feedback on how they are doing including encouragement to try again with randomly selected questions. I want the user to feel positive throughout and after completing the quiz as well as inspired to attempt it again.

### Structure
The quiz is structured into three main stages:

1. **Welcome page:** Users are greeted with the main title of the quiz, 'Landmarks,' and provided with instructions on how to begin. They can initiate the quiz by clicking a designated button that leads them to the first question.
2. **Questions:** Each question is accompanied by a corresponding image, the question itself, and four answer options. Upon selecting an option, users receive instant feedback, and additional information about the landmark is provided. Users can proceed to the next question by clicking the 'Next' button.
3. **Feedback page:** The user's final score is displayed, along with feedback indicating their performance. They are encouraged to retake the quiz by clicking the 'Play again' button.

Each page includes **footer** containing information about the creator of the quiz.

### Skeleton
The website is designed to be clear and simple, with the main purpose of entertainment and education at the same time. Features are arranged hierarchically to follow the order of importance.

### Surface

#### Colour Palette

I uesed this as base colour palette for clean and esthetic look.

The base colours have been complemented with these softer, more pastel colours for displaying correct answers and the footer. The aim was for positive user experience by avoiding rich, 'shouting' colours.

#### Images
The images used for this quiz are to represent the landmark and so it is recognised from the visual representation.
